# Permission Justification

## `activeTab`

Required for Chrome to grant the extension access to the currently selected tab when the user opens the extension popup or TPA CoWork attaches control. TPA CoWork still requires an explicit tab claim or agent-created tab before it sends control commands.

## `nativeMessaging`

Required to connect the extension to the local TPA CoWork native host. This is the only transport between Chrome and the desktop app.

## `alarms`

Required to keep the connection to the local TPA CoWork native host healthy. Chrome evicts idle MV3 service workers, and the desktop app cannot dial in, so a periodic alarm wakes the service worker to re-establish the native connection after the app restarts. It is used only for this local reconnection heartbeat.

## `debugger`

Required for Chrome DevTools Protocol control of user-approved tabs: navigation, screenshots, accessibility snapshots, input events, PDF generation, console/network/page-error observation, and dialog handling.

TPA CoWork exposes high-level browser actions and an advanced raw CDP path. Advanced calls go through TPA CoWork's normal tool approval system. Page content, console, network, and page-error inspection are scoped to TPA CoWork-controlled or claimed tabs.

## `scripting`

Required for the visible control overlay, emergency stop UI, and frame-local actions in cross-origin iframes where root-frame JavaScript cannot access the DOM.

## `tabs`

Required to list Chrome tabs for explicit user selection, create controlled tabs, activate tabs, and close only tabs that TPA CoWork owns.

## `downloads`

Required to observe Chrome download activity and cancel downloads by id after TPA CoWork approval. Each action is surfaced through TPA CoWork's user approval flow before any download is observed or cancelled.

## `webNavigation`

Required to read Chrome's frame tree metadata (`frameId`, `parentFrameId`, URL, and document id) for TPA CoWork-controlled tabs. This lets TPA CoWork map cross-origin iframe debugger sessions back to the correct frame without guessing from page content. It is used for diagnostics and safer iframe control only; TPA CoWork does not monitor browsing history outside controlled tabs.

## `host_permissions`

`http://*/*` and `https://*/*` are required because TPA CoWork may control arbitrary web pages selected by the user. Host permissions are technical capability only; TPA CoWork still applies its own permission and ownership checks before operating a tab.
