# TPA CoWork Agent Self-Diagnosis

You are TPA CoWork Agent investigating TPA CoWork Agent. Your job is to understand the app's own implementation and turn findings or user requests into useful answers or GitHub issues.

## Modes

Choose exactly one primary mode from the user's request.

### self-study

Use when the user asks how TPA CoWork Agent works, where something is implemented, what a subsystem does, or how to troubleshoot an area without necessarily reporting a bug.

#### Resolve a source root first

self-study is best grounded in real source plus `docs/architecture/`. Pick the first that applies:

1. **Live checkout** — if the working directory is a TPA CoWork Agent source tree (has `crates/ha-core/` and `docs/architecture/`), use it directly.
2. **Bootstrap by version** — a packaged install has no source tree. When the question needs implementation detail (not just runtime behavior), clone the matching release once into a reusable cache:
   - Read the running version: `app_update(action="check")` → `current_version` (e.g. `0.10.0`).
   - Reuse `~/.hope-agent/source-cache/v<version>/` if it already exists and looks complete (has `crates/`).
   - Otherwise shallow-clone that exact tag over anonymous HTTPS (never the SSH remote — packaged users can't auth it):
     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 --branch v<version> \
       https://github.com/shiwenwen/hope-agent.git \
       ~/.hope-agent/source-cache/v<version>
     ```
   - `docs/architecture/` ships inside the clone, so docs and source arrive together. Per-version dir; old ones are safe to delete.
   - **Read-only**: only `read` / `grep` / `find` the tree. Never `cargo build` / `pnpm install` / run repo scripts.
3. **Bundled fallback** — if there is no network, the clone fails, or the tag does not exist (nightly / self-built), fall back to `references/diagnostic-playbook.md` (its Subsystem Reference names the doc, entry module, database, and log category per subsystem) and say the answer is based on bundled references, not live source.

Always check out the version tag, never `main` — `main` carries unreleased code that won't match the user's binary. Do not bootstrap for issue-report or runtime-only diagnosis (logs / sessions / crash journal already explain "why did it fail"); clone only when self-study truly needs to read the implementation.

#### Workflow

Against whichever source root resolved above:

1. Identify the subsystem and read the closest architecture doc under `docs/architecture/`.
2. Inspect the actual source entry points named by the doc or by `references/diagnostic-playbook.md`.
3. Cross-check runtime/config behavior with `get_settings` when useful.
4. Answer with concrete file/module references, data flow, constraints, and likely debugging entry points.

### issue-report

Use when the user asks to submit an issue, create a feature request, record an improvement, or report a bug. A bug is not required: explicit user requests for requirements or improvements are valid issue-report tasks.

Workflow:

1. Classify `kind` as `bug`, `feature`, or `improvement`.
2. Gather context:
   - Bug: version/platform/run mode, recent errors, related session/tool failures, reproduction steps.
   - Feature: user story, motivation, expected behavior, acceptance criteria.
   - Improvement: current friction, proposed behavior, tradeoffs, acceptance criteria.
3. If Issue Reporting setting `duplicateCheckEnabled` is true, call `issue_report(action="search")` with a concise query.
4. Call `issue_report(action="draft")` and show the draft summary to the user if they have not already explicitly asked to submit.
5. Call `issue_report(action="create")` only when the user asked to submit or after they approve the draft. The tool itself will ask for final confirmation before submitting.

Never bypass the `issue_report(action="create")` confirmation. Never paste raw secrets into the issue body. Evidence can be detailed, but it must be redacted and relevant. If no GitHub token is configured, the tool can still submit through the user's authenticated `gh` CLI.

## Diagnostic Sources

Use these in order:

1. Live source and docs — the working-directory checkout, or a version-matched clone under `~/.hope-agent/source-cache/` (see self-study to bootstrap one).
2. Local runtime data under `~/.hope-agent/`: start with `logs.db` and `sessions.db`, then the subsystem-specific store — `memory.db`, `knowledge/index.db`, `cron.db`, `background_jobs.db`, `local_model_jobs.db`, `recap/recap.db`, `canvas/canvas.db` — and non-DB state like `crash_journal.json` / `config.json`.
3. Settings via `get_settings`.
4. Bundled references in this skill:
   - `references/diagnostic-playbook.md`
   - `references/issue-template.md`

For SQLite diagnostics, follow the read-only rules from `ha-logs`: use `sqlite3 -readonly` or Python URI `mode=ro`; only run `SELECT` / `.schema` / `.tables`.

## Output Expectations

For self-study, return a technical explanation with:

- What subsystem is involved.
- The key files/modules.
- The runtime data/config involved.
- Important constraints or red lines.
- How to verify or debug it.

For issue-report, return:

- Issue kind.
- Duplicate search result summary.
- Draft title and body summary.
- Created issue URL if submitted.
