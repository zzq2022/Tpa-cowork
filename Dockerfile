# TPA CoWork — multi-arch container image for `tpa-cowork server`.
#
# Stage 1 (web)     — node:20-bookworm-slim builds the Vite frontend to `/work/dist/`.
#                     Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM so we run pnpm exactly once even
#                     for multi-arch builds (frontend output is arch-agnostic).
#                     Node stage doesn't have the glibc constraint below.
# Stage 2 (rust)    — rust:1.95.0-trixie builds the `tpa-cowork` binary.
#                     The web `dist/` is copied in BEFORE `cargo build` so
#                     `crates/ha-server/build.rs` sees the real assets and
#                     `rust-embed` bakes them into the binary.
# Stage 3 (runtime) — debian:trixie-slim — ca-certs + tzdata + wget + a few
#                     desktop-tool shared libs (see runtime stage comment).
#                     Runs as non-root user `tpa-cowork` (uid 1000) with /data
#                     persisted as the configurable TPA_COWORK_DATA_DIR.
#
# Glibc note: trixie (Debian 13, glibc 2.41) on both build and runtime is
# required because `ort-sys` (pulled in by fastembed for embeddings) ships
# prebuilt ONNX Runtime binaries that reference `__isoc23_strtol` from
# glibc 2.38+. bookworm (glibc 2.36) fails to link. release.yml already
# targets ubuntu-24.04 (glibc 2.39), so this is consistent with the bare-
# binary baseline. Keep both stages on the same distro — mixing trixie
# build / bookworm runtime would dynamically fail to load at startup.
