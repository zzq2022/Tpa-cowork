const TOOL_DESC_EXEC: &str = "\
- exec: Execute shell commands and return output.\n\
  - Supports cwd, timeout, custom env vars. Omit timeout by default; set a positive timeout only for a user-requested deadline or a short bounded probe (0 = no exec command timeout; positives cap at 2h)\n\
  - Background execution: for ordinary long-running commands, use run_in_background=true so async_jobs owns status, cancellation, output tail, and completion notification\n\
  - Legacy process-session mode: background=true or yield_ms only when you truly need the process session surface; legacy flags are migrated to async jobs when async tools are enabled\n\
  - Docker sandbox isolation: sandbox=true for untrusted or risky commands\n\
  - IMPORTANT: Prefer dedicated tools over exec for common operations:\n\
    - Read files → use `read` (not cat/head/tail)\n\
    - Edit files → use `edit` (not sed/awk)\n\
    - Create files → use `write` (not echo/cat heredoc)\n\
    - Search content → use `grep` (not grep/rg command)\n\
    - Find files → use `find` (not find command)\n\
  - For long-running commands (builds, installs), use run_in_background=true and rely on job_status snapshots or the automatic <task-notification> result\n\
  - Use absolute paths throughout; avoid cd unless user explicitly requests it\n\
  - When creating files/dirs, first verify parent directory exists with ls\n\
  - Quote file paths containing spaces with double quotes\n\
  - For sequential dependent commands, chain with && in a single call\n\
  - For independent commands, make separate parallel exec calls";

const TOOL_DESC_PROCESS: &str = "\
- process: Manage legacy exec process sessions.\n\
  - Actions: list, poll (get new output), log (full output), write (stdin), kill, clear, remove\n\
  - Use only for process-session commands created with exec(background=true) or yield_ms; ordinary async exec jobs use job_status instead\n\
  - Running process output is streamed to the UI, and completed background processes can notify the conversation with <process-notification>\n\
  - Do not poll in a loop with sleep — use process(log) only when you need more detail";

const TOOL_DESC_READ: &str = "\
- read: Read file contents with line-based pagination (offset/limit).\n\
  - Default: up to 2000 lines from beginning of file\n\
  - When you know which part you need, only read that part (important for large files)\n\
  - Auto-detects image files (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/BMP/TIFF) and returns base64; oversized images auto-resized\n\
  - For large PDFs (>10 pages), MUST specify pages parameter (max 20 pages per request)\n\
  - Can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) with all cells and outputs\n\
  - Accepts both 'path' and 'file_path'\n\
  - IMPORTANT: Read files BEFORE proposing modifications — understand existing code first\n\
  - Can only read files, not directories. Use `ls` for directory listings";

const TOOL_DESC_WRITE: &str = "\
- write: Write content to a file (overwrites existing).\n\
  - Prefer `edit` tool for modifying existing files — it sends only the diff\n\
  - Only create new files when absolutely necessary — prefer editing existing files to prevent file bloat\n\
  - If overwriting an existing file, MUST read it first to understand current content\n\
  - Do NOT create documentation files (*.md) or README unless explicitly requested\n\
  - Accepts both 'path' and 'file_path'";

const TOOL_DESC_EDIT: &str = "\
- edit: Targeted search-replace edits (old_text → new_text).\n\
  - ALWAYS prefer over `write` for modifications — sends only the diff\n\
  - old_text must be unique in the file — provide more surrounding context if not unique\n\
  - Use replace_all=true to rename variables/strings across the entire file\n\
  - Empty new_text deletes the matched text\n\
  - Preserve exact indentation from the source file\n\
  - Accepts aliases: file_path, oldText/old_string, newText/new_string";

const TOOL_DESC_LS: &str = "\
- ls: List directory contents (sorted, with / and @ indicators).\n\
  - Supports ~ expansion, limit param, 50KB output cap\n\
  - Use to verify directory structure before creating files";

- grep: Search file contents with regex or literal patterns.\n\
  - ALWAYS use this tool for content search — never grep/rg via exec\n\
  - Respects .gitignore automatically\n\
  - Full regex syntax supported; literal braces need escaping (e.g., interface\\{\\})\n\
  - For patterns spanning multiple lines, use multiline=true\n\
  - Params: pattern (required), path, glob, ignore_case, literal, context, limit (default 100)\n\
  - For open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds, use subagent instead";

const TOOL_DESC_FIND: &str = "\
- find: Find files by glob pattern.\n\
  - ALWAYS use this tool for file search — never find via exec\n\
  - Respects .gitignore automatically\n\
  - Params: pattern (required), path, limit (default 1000)";

const TOOL_DESC_APPLY_PATCH: &str = "\
- apply_patch: Apply multi-file patches (add/update/delete/move files).\n\
  - Use *** Begin Patch / *** End Patch format with Add File, Update File, Delete File markers\n\
  - Update hunks use @@ context + -/+ line prefixes with 3-pass fuzzy matching\n\
  - Preferred for large-scale changes across multiple files";

const TOOL_DESC_WEB_SEARCH: &str = "\
- web_search: Search the web for information.\n\
  - Use when you need current information not available in the codebase\n\
  - Returns search results with titles, snippets, and URLs";

  - Use when the user shares personal info, preferences, corrections, or says \"remember this\"\n\
  - Params: content (required), type (user/feedback/project/reference), tags (optional array), scope (global/agent/project)\n\
  - In a project session, omitted scope defaults to project; outside a project it defaults to global. Use scope explicitly when the intended boundary differs.\n\

- recall_memory: Search persistent memories by keyword or semantic query.\n\
  - Use to recall user preferences, project context, or previously stored information\n\

const TOOL_DESC_MANAGE_CRON: &str = "\
- manage_cron: Create, list, update, or delete scheduled tasks.\n\
  - Actions: create, list, get, update, delete, run_now\n\
  - Use for reminders, scheduled follow-ups, and recurring nudges over time\n\
  - For requests like \"remind me in 10 minutes\" or \"every 10 minutes for an hour\", create a scheduled task instead of simulating time with exec/date\n\
  - Cron expressions follow standard format (minute hour day month weekday)";

const TOOL_DESC_BROWSER: &str = "\
- browser: Interact with web pages via a headless browser.\n\
  - Supports navigation, screenshots, clicking, typing, JavaScript execution, and page snapshots\n\
  - `new_page` is the usual entry point: it uses the current explicit connection if one exists, otherwise auto-launches a managed Chrome\n\
  - Managed launches start with a large responsive window instead of a fixed 800x600 viewport; use `resize` only when you need a specific viewport\n\
  - Use for dynamic web pages that web_fetch cannot handle";

const TOOL_DESC_SEND_NOTIFICATION: &str = "\
- send_notification: Send a system notification to the user.\n\
  - Use for important alerts when the user may not be watching the conversation\n\

- subagent: Spawn and manage sub-agents to delegate tasks.\n\
  - Actions: spawn, check, list, result, kill, kill_all, steer, batch_spawn, wait_all, spawn_and_wait\n\
  - Sub-agents run asynchronously — results are auto-pushed as `<subagent-result>` user messages when complete\n\
  - spawn/batch_spawn `timeout_secs`: omit by default to use the parent Agent default (default 0/no timeout); set positive values only for explicitly bounded child tasks; 0 = no timeout; positives cap at 1800s\n\
  - spawn_and_wait: spawn + wait up to foreground_timeout (default 30s, max 120s). If completes in time, returns result inline. Otherwise auto-backgrounds — result injected later\n\
  - Use steer to redirect a running sub-agent without killing it";

const TOOL_DESC_MEMORY_GET: &str = "\
- memory_get: Retrieve a specific memory entry by ID with full content and metadata.\n\
  - Use after recall_memory to get the complete details of a specific memory";

  - Use wait=true to block until the other session responds";

const TOOL_DESC_IMAGE: &str = "\
- image: Attach local/URL/clipboard/screenshot images as visual input for the next model round.\n\
  - The tool itself does not analyze images; use task/question to say what the vision model should inspect\n\
  - Supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF; prefer images[].label for multi-image references";

const TOOL_DESC_IMAGE_GENERATE: &str = "\
- image_generate: Generate images from text descriptions using AI image generation models.\n\

  - Returns current temperature, humidity, wind, weather conditions, and daily forecast";

const TOOL_DESC_TASK_CREATE: &str = "\
- task_create: Batch-create trackable todos for the current session (array input).\n\
  - Use proactively: 3+ distinct steps, non-trivial multi-step work, user-provided lists, after new instructions\n\
  - Skip: single trivial actions, pure conversation, tasks completable in ≤3 steps\n\
  - Batch rule: pass ALL todos in one call via `tasks: [...]` — do NOT chain multiple task_create calls\n\
  - Each task: { content (imperative, e.g. \"Run tests\"), activeForm? (present-continuous, e.g. \"Running tests\"; shown when in_progress) }\n\

currently forced to true by the runtime so a free-form input is always rendered), multi_select \
(default false), template (scope/tech_choice/priority), header (≤12 char chip), timeout_secs, default_values\n\
  - Per option: value, label, description, recommended (mark the first recommended option with \
'(Recommended)' in label), preview (markdown / image URL / mermaid source for visual comparison), previewKind\n\

Effective collaboration depends on knowing when to ask vs. when to act. Use `ask_user_question` as the standard channel for structured questions — not as a last-resort escape hatch.

**Ask the user** when:
- About to perform an irreversible or high-cost action (deleting >5 files, DB migration, force push, dependency major bump)
- The request is genuinely ambiguous with no obviously correct interpretation
- Multiple viable approaches with comparable tradeoffs exist
- You're stuck after ≥2 failed attempts on the same problem — escalate instead of thrashing

**Do NOT ask** when:
- The answer is discoverable via read/grep/ls or already documented in AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / existing code — investigate first
- The operation is low-cost and reversible (creating a test file, adding a log line) — just do it
- It's a pure style / formatting / naming detail the user likely has no opinion on

**How to ask**:
- Batch related questions into a single `ask_user_question` call (up to 4 questions)
- At most 1–2 calls per task; prefer asking early (before execution) over mid-task interruptions
- If you find yourself about to ask a second time, reconsider whether you can investigate instead";
