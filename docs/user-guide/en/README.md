# TPA CoWork User Guide

> [简体中文](../README.md) · **English**

> This is a complete user-facing manual that covers TPA CoWork's installation, getting started, and the usage and settings for every feature.
> If you want to understand the code architecture and implementation details, see [`docs/architecture/`](../../architecture/); for a quick tour of the product highlights, see the root [README.md](../../../README.en.md).

## How to read this guide

- **First time using it**: read in order [01 · Getting Started](01-getting-started.md) → [02 · Models & Providers](02-models-and-providers.md) → [03 · Chat & Sessions](03-chat-and-sessions.md), and you'll be up and running in ten minutes.
- **Want a specific feature**: jump straight to the matching chapter—each chapter is self-contained and can be read on its own.
- **Want to change a setting**: start with the "Settings navigation map" in [13 · Settings & Security](13-settings-and-security.md); it tells you "which panel to go to for X".
- **Ran into an unfamiliar term**: see the [Core concepts](#core-concepts-all-in-one-place) section at the bottom of this page.

> Whenever the text mentions a **slash command** (such as `/goal`), you can type it directly in the chat input box; whenever it mentions a **settings panel**, it lives under "Settings" in the bottom-left corner of the app; whenever it mentions a **tool** (such as `exec` or `note_*`), that is a capability the AI invokes automatically during a conversation—you usually don't need to trigger it by hand, but you can govern it in the permission settings.

## What is TPA CoWork

TPA CoWork is a **local-first, desktop-first personal AI assistant that can also run as a resident service**. It opens and works like mature desktop software, yet has the real action-taking power of an Agent:

- **It remembers**—across sessions it remembers your preferences, project context, and long-term habits, understanding you better the more you use it;
- **It grows**—it distills complex tasks into reusable skills and turns your material into a second brain;
- **It advances goals autonomously**—you give it a goal, and it keeps breaking it down, executing, checking, and pushing it forward in the background;
- **It can truly operate**—under your authorization and approval, it runs commands, reads and writes files, controls the browser and your computer, and calls external tools;
- **It's always on call**—desktop, browser, and common IMs (Telegram / Feishu / Slack, etc.) share one set of sessions, memory, and configuration.

By default all data is stored on your own computer (`~/.tpa-cowork/`), and model requests connect directly to the Provider you configured, without passing through any third-party relay.

## Core concepts (all in one place)

Understanding the following groups of concepts will help you quickly make sense of the whole guide:

**Two run modes**—one core, two entry points:
- **Desktop GUI**: the most fully featured native app (Windows / Kylin Linux supported), ready to use out of the box.
- **Server + Web GUI**: `tpa-cowork server` runs resident in the background (NAS / server / cloud host); open a browser to get the full web version, and phones and tablets can connect too.

**The five roles of autonomous execution** (combine them or use each on its own):
- **Goal**—defines "what ultimately needs to be achieved and what counts as done".
- **Workflow**—handles "a single concrete execution", which can include stages, parallelism, multiple Agents, review, and verification.
- **Loop**—decides "when to push forward again" (on a schedule, a condition, or a time the model sets itself).
- **Task**—shows "the current progress".
- **Execution Mode**—controls "how aggressively it executes autonomously".

**Three dedicated capability centers**:
- **Memory**—remembers important facts across sessions, split into Global / Project / Agent tiers and recalled on demand.
- **Knowledge Space**—a real Markdown note library that you and the AI read and write together, your "second brain".
- **SkillHub & Skill Center**—the hub for discovering, downloading, creating, and managing Agent skills online.

**Tools and approval**—the AI actually operates your computer, files, browser, and external services through "tools"; sensitive operations enter an **approval** flow where you can confirm each time, always allow, or reject. Permissions have three modes: `Default`, `Smart Approval`, and `YOLO` (allow everything).

**Local-first**—by default, configuration, sessions, memory, attachments, skills, and logs all live in `~/.tpa-cowork/` on your machine; API keys connect directly to the model Provider; server mode provides Bearer Token authentication and SSRF protection.
